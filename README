This repository documents testing various version and configurations of IBM
Spectrum LSF and their Common Workflow Language exectutor (CWLEXEC) against the
CWL v1.0 conformance tests.

IBM Spectrum LSF Community Edition 10.1
---------------------------------------
This edition of LSF does not include the LSF Docker for workloads feature.

It is limited to single or dual-socket processor hosts; so a VM (or real machine) with
only one or two CPU sockets is supported.

To run the test:

```
cd lsf-ce-10.1
docker build .
```

Current results: `75 tests passed, 34 failures, 19 unsupported features`

I don't know of any Docker container executor that correctly lies/presents the
number of processors actually available, so a VM or real machine with no more
than two CPUs is necessary for all Community Edition coordinators ("master")
and workers ("slave") hosts.

Docker notes

Non Community Edition versions of LSF 10.1 starting with Fix Pack 1 and onwards
support the use of Docker Engine (Version 1.12+) for the execution of
workloads (or jobs in CWL parlance).
